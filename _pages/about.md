I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at Michigan State University, working under the guidance of <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html">Prof. Xiaoming Liu</a>. I previously graduated with Ph. D. degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://en.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a> where I was advised by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37325735600">Prof. Zhisheng You</a> and <a href="http://scubrl.org/qjzhao">Prof. Qijun Zhao</a>.

My research interests lie in computer vision, machine learning, human-AI interaction, Generative AI and Multimodal AI. Specifically, I study 3D object/scene understanding, including 3D <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-implicit-dense-correspondence.html">correspondence</a>, <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-mdr.html">detection</a>, <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-fully3dobject.html">reconstruction</a> and vision+language understanding. I am also interested in understanding explainability, <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-gansvr.html">generalization</a> and <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-cfsm.html">controllability</a> in generative models, such as GANs and Diffusion Models. In addition, I have a significant amount of experience in 3D face reconstruction, <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-caface.html">face recognition</a>, and <a href="http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu/project-ffd.html">DeepFake detection</a>.
